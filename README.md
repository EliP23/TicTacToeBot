# TicTacToeBot
Java bot to play tic tac toe against. There are two difficulty settings, each with their own set of rules for playing a piece back.
I wanted to take a next step forward in pushing myself to learn. I took a somewhat simple game to play, tic tac toe, and built a weak AI to play against
The AI is not perfect, but does a great job playing pieces back.
